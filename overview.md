This is a Freedom Project which is a project that allows people to have the freedom or the privilege to research any topic they want
and research about it.Then they are suppose to present the information that they found to inform others about their topic.However,the
students are suppose to reltae what they learn in class to the topic that they are researching about. The blogs here are a progress
report of how I have done my project day by day.I am making . a website about Virtual Reality using Github,HTML, and CSS. This blog
will document the process of independently studying Virtual Reality and making the website.
